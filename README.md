Hello friends, I'm Reza Rashidi. Here is my teaching slides of relative orientation of two image with co-linearity equations to make the 3d model.

I I defined a project at the end of slides:

* Using the given coordinates for the two left and right photos,
* perform two-way relative justification and generate model coordinates.

this code is for that project in matlab
